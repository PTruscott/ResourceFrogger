# ResourceHogger
Resource Frogger is a project written in 24h at BrumHack hackathon. Written entirely in java, RF is a frogger type game in which the player attempts to cross a series of roads while avoiding cars. I used Open Transport Net flow data to populate roads which the player has to cross.  This involved downloading the historical data XML files for the flow rate.  Each of these files contain the name of the location, the date and time the data was recorded, and the data itself
